# Final-Project
### Final Project for CSCI-127

I created a maze that a person can move through and complete (gaining a reward) using a GUI and two classes.
The two class being the Maze class and the Board class. The maze class compiles all the information
relating to the maze that can be navigated, while the board class allows different mazes to be chosen from.
Currently, the board class only contains one maze template, but allows for expansion. The majority of the
current code allows for further expansion in the future.

Hopes for the future of this code is to create more mazes, and possibly allow for random generation of 
maze templates. I also would like the GUI to run more smoothly. In order to move, the player must click a button
and then click the arrow button on the keyboard. I would like to improve the program to not need the player
to click the button, so that all the movement can be done from the keyboard.

The Driver file is only needed for debugging purposes.
